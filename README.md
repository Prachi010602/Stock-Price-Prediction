This project focuses on the analysis and prediction of stock data for major tech companies like Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Tesla (TSLA). The data used is the historical stock information of each stock, various metrics, and advanced machine learning techniques. 

The data used is the historical stock information of each stock, various metrics, and advanced machine learning techniques. This project aims to provide valuable insights for investors.

I have implemented Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Simple RNN model using Keras for stock analysis. The model is designed to predict stock prices based on historical data. We need to be aware that the market is very unpredictable so we canâ€™t always predict it accurately and this project is only for educational purposes.

# Problem Statement:

Background: Predict the future stock prices of the stocks using the previous stock prices.
Objective: Aims to empower users with a comprehensive understanding of historical stock trends, risk assessment strategies, and the potential for future price prediction using advanced deep learning techniques.
Scope: This project will be done on a few Famous Tech stocks.
